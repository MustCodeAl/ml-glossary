Basic concepts in probability for machine learning.

This cheatsheet is a 10-page reference in probability that covers a semester's worth of introductory probability.

The cheatsheet is based off of Harvard's introductory probability course, Stat 110. It is co-authored by former Stat 110 Teaching Fellow William Chen and Stat 110 Professor Joe Blitzstein.


**Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that tells how likely something is to happen. If something is sure to happen, the probability is 1. 
If something can never happen, the probability is 0. We write the probability of something as P(thing), where "thing" is what we're talking about.


Events
======
An event is represented as a group (set) of all possible results. This group is a part (subset) of all possible outcomes.



The total probability of the outcomes in X must be 1, i.e., P(X) = 1.
Since the events in probability theory are sets, we can manipulate them using
standard set operations:
• The **complement A¯ means ”A does not happen”. For example, when
throwing a dice, the complement of A = {2,4,6} is A¯ = {1,3,5}.
• The union A ∪ B means ”A or B happen”. For example, the union of
A = {2,5} and B = {4,5,6} is A ∪B = {2,4,5,6}.
• The intersection A ∩B means ”A and B happen”. For example, the intersection of A = {2,5} and B = {4,5,6} is A ∩B = {5}.

A **random variable** is a value that is generated by a random process. For
example, when throwing two dice, a possible random variable is
